SIXAXIS pad over Bluetooth on Ubuntu Precise
Posted: 2012-07-20


Summary

Sony Playstation 3 SIXAXIS pads still don’t work over Bluetooth out of the box 
in Ubuntu Precise, but might with my repackaged bluez deb. If you prefer 
to roll your own, running sixpair manually is probably the easiest way to pair 
if you do it rarely; patches to enable hot-pairing of pads haven’t made it 
into bluez packages, except Fedora’s and mine. Ubuntu Precise’s bluez also 
needed a hack to work around an apparent bug that stopped hid-sony from loading, 
manifesting as /dev/input/js0 appearing but jstest giving no events.


Context

Back in 2007 I bought some PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS pads with a view to using them 
over Bluetooth for retro gaming on emulators, after seeing the motion tracking 
and helicopter videos on YouTube that were Linux-driven. OS X’s closed 
Bluetooth stack made wireless too difficult to bother attempting, so they sat 
in a box except for the occasional use over USB. On Linux in 2012 (Ubuntu 
Precise) you might think they’d just work by now.


A Brief History of SIXAXIS on Linux over Bluetooth

Owing to Sony’s “embrace-and-extend”-style use of Bluetooth, two hacks are 
required to get SIXAXIS working over Bluetooth. One, pairing has to happen 
while connected over USB. Two, the controller has to be kicked out of the 
non-standard mode it ends up in after its initial exchange with the host.

The latter (mode) problem is solved, the workaround having made it into 
a mainline Linux kernel module, hid-sony. In theory the Linux userspace 
Bluetooth stack, BlueZ, handles an already-paired SIXAXIS just fine in 4.x. 
Pairing over cables has progressed from being achieved by manually running 
a special standalone binary to being achieved by a special BlueZ patch 
that auto-pairs when you plug in. In my opinion BlueZ’s code has always 
been decent but its support (documentation, maintenance, responsiveness) 
has always let it down, and the cable-based pairing patch submission is 
an example, Antonio Ospite’s enthusiasm having been worn away by seeing 
his clean-up efforts being largely ignored on the linux-bluetooth mailing list. 
Today it seems you can choose from his various attempts and Fedora’s pairing patch.


Ubuntu

In Ubuntu Precise, sixpair is still the easiest way to pair in my opinion. 
I did get Fedora’s pairing patch applied and working in Ubuntu Precise 
(.deb below), but as I only ever use the pads with my laptop and therefore 
only have to pair once per OS reinstall, I wouldn’t do it again.

After pairing, unplugging and pressing the PlayStation button on the SIXAXIS, 
I got no events from jstest. The logs said:

The “Fixing up Sony Sixaxis report descriptor” message comes from hid-sony.c 
but didn’t appear for me when connecting over Bluetooth. The cause, though not 
the root cause, was that the hid-core module only loads hid-blah modules when 
devices with corresponding registered vendor/product IDs appear. BlueZ passes 
0000:0000 when the SIXAXIS connects over Bluetooth meaning that hid-sony never 
gets called.

I can’t see why this would only affect me but I don’t see any mention of this 
problem elsewhere. The proper fix would be to make sure vendor/product IDs 
get copied through to the HID registration, but the linux-bluetooth list’s 
indifference and unresponsiveness is disheartening and demotivating enough 
that I can’t even see much point in raising the general bug, so here’s 
my dirty little hack:

The impatient-but-trusting might be interested in my repackaged bluez deb, 
complete with Fedora’s cable-based, hotplug-style pairing and the dirty 
little patch above. While I promise nothing in terms of support, I’d be 
interested to know how you get on.

My Ubuntu deb-fu isn’t up to building source packages or PPAs but the monolithic 
patch (against a freshly unpacked bluez_4.98.orig.tar.gz) which I assembled 
is available for those who are curious, suspicious and/or want to roll their own.

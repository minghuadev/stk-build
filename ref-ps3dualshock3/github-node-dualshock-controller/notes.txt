========================================================


Based on the following [Guide](http://www.raspians.com/Knowledgebase/ps3-dualshock-controller-install-on-the-raspberry-pi/) but I made some finds/discoveries that I have documented.

I followed these steps in both raspbian 3.10.25 and Linux Mint 3.8.0-19-generic

## you will need the following dependencies

* bluez-utils
* bluez-compat
* bluez-hcidump
* checkinstall
* libusb-dev
* libbluetooth-dev
* joystick
* pyqt4-dev-tools


> sudo apt-get install bluez-utils bluez-compat bluez-hcidump checkinstall libusb-dev libbluetooth-dev joystick pyqt4-dev-tools

## sixpair tool
you will need sixpair to initiate the pairing with the controller, unfortunately it is not available using the package manager so we will need to download and build it:

> wget http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixpair.c

> gcc -o sixpair sixpair.c -lusb

## sixad tool
will allow you to finish the pairing, you can use a PPA but I would not recommend it as on both systems I set up I had to patch the source because of existing issues.

### Install from source

> wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtsixa/files/QtSixA%201.5.1/QtSixA-1.5.1-src.tar.gz

> tar xfvz QtSixA-1.5.1-src.tar.gz

> cd QtSixA-1.5.1/sixad

> make

> sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/sixad/profiles

> sudo checkinstall


### Install from PPA (I don't recommend)
> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:falk-t-j/qtsixa

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install qtsixa

## Pair and test

connect the DS3 controller now then run:

in the sixpair folder you built sixpair in the step before.
> sudo ./sixpair

>sudo sixad --start

you should see:

>started

> sixad started, press the PS button now

disconnect the DS3 Controller now and press the PS button, you should see:

>started

>Connected 'PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (44:D8:32:B4:04:F2)' [Battery 05]

you can test if the controller has been paired:

you should see js0 if you run:
>ls /dev/input/

you should see data if you run:
>sudo jstest /dev/input/js0

### Setting it up to run at start

> sudo update-rc.d sixad defaults

Much of the information on this page applies to old versions (3.x) of 
the Bluetooth userspace stack (bluez) found in 8.04/Hardy and below, 
not the the current versions (4.x) found in 8.10/Intrepid and above. 
Approaches that are more current include:

    QTSixA, a dedicated SIXAXIS manager project supporting both USB and Bluetooth (PPA provided)

    Bug 124743, a feature request for SIXAXIS Bluetooth support built into Ubuntu's own bluez

    An Ubuntu user's custom bluez .deb for 12.04 Precise adding support for the SIXAXIS, plus details of what went into it and why

Following on from the work of previous posters, I've built a version 
with the SIXAXIS pairing patch for Trusty and uploaded it to a ppa at 
https://launchpad.net/~nadia-xy/+archive/ppa. Hopefully if/when Ubuntu 
moves to Bluez 5 this won't be an issue anymore as Bluez 5 appears 
to support this in recent versions without patching.
